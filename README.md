Create a simplified ATM Simulation program where the user interacts with an ATM-like interface through the command line. The user can perform basic transactions, such as checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

Here is how the program works:

(1) The program starts with a default balance of $100 and displays the options (e.g., check balance, deposit, etc.)

(2) The user chooses an option number (e.g., 3 for depositing) and then follows the instructions (e.g., enters a deposit amount).

(3) The program calculates the updated balance and prints out the messages again and the updated balance.
